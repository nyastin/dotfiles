# Dotfiles Setup Guide

## Setup Steps

1.  **Install Homebrew**

    1. Open a terminal and run:
       ```sh
       /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
       ```

2.  **Install the following packages using Homebrew:**

    1. `stow`
    2. `alacritty`
    3. `tmux`
    4. `eza`
    5. `zsh-syntax-highlighting`
    6. `zsh-autosuggestions`
    7. `zoxide`
    8. `pnpm`
    9. `starship`
    10. `gh`
    11. `ripgrep`
    12. `tree`
    13. `lazygit`
    14. `fd`

    Run the following command in the terminal:

    ```sh
    brew install stow alacritty tmux eza zsh-syntax-highlighting zsh-autosuggestions zoxide pnpm starship gh ripgrep tree lazygit fd
    ```

3.  **Install Rust (needed for Cargo)**

    1. Follow the instructions on [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This will install `cargo` as well.

       ```sh
       curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
       ```

4.  **Install bob-nvim & tmux-sessionizer using Cargo**

    1. Run the following command in the terminal:
       ```sh
       cargo install bob-nvim tmux-sessionizer
       ```
    2. Install and use the stable version of Neovim:
       ```sh
       bob install stable
       bob use stable
       ```
    3. Run the following command in the terminal and specify the path of `Developer` folder:
       ```sh
        tms config -p PATH HERE
       ```

5.  **Clone your dotfiles repository**

    1. Run the following command in the terminal:

       ```sh
       git clone https://github.com/nyastin/dotfiles ~/.config
       ```

6.  **Clone Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)**

    1. Run the following command in the terminal:

       ```sh
       git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
       ```

7.  **Install oh-my-zsh**

    1.  Open a terminal and run:

        ```sh
        sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
        ```

    2.  Delete `.zshrc` generated by `oh-my-zsh` by running(this will be replaced later stowed from ~/dotfiles):

        ```sh
        rm .zshrc
        ```

8.  **Use Stow to manage dotfiles**

    1. Navigate to the `dotfiles` directory:

       ```sh
       cd ~/dotfiles
       ```

    2. Stow the desired dotfiles:

       ```sh
       stow nvim
       stow zsh
       stow alacritty
       stow starship
       ```

9.  **Tmux plugins installation**

    1. Run the `tmux` command
    2. Press `prefix + I` (capital i, as in Install) to fetch the plugins listed stored in .tmux.conf.
       Plugin Inclusions:

       ```sh
       catppuccin/tmux
       tmux-plugins/tmux-battery
       ```

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have `git` installed to clone your dotfiles repository.
- Adjust the list of packages in step 2 as needed based on your preferences.
- If you encounter any issues during the installation of Rust or other tools, refer to their respective documentation for troubleshooting.
